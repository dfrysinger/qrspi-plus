# Reviewer Boilerplate (shared)

This file is the single consolidated reviewer-shared content asset for the QRSPI pipeline. It defines the shared finding contract that the reviewer templates listed below will embed verbatim — every Claude reviewer subagent prompt, the cross-cutting `scope-reviewer` template, and every Codex reviewer call site constructed by QRSPI skills. Task 1 of this run only creates this asset; Task 11 wires the actual embeds into those call sites.

This file is **designed to grow**. Future reviewer-shared content (reviewer tone guidance, fact-vs-opinion guardrails, severity rubric reminders, etc.) is added as **additional sections** to this same file rather than as new files. The file path and file name are stable across edits so embed references in skill prompts do not need to change.

The current set of sections — `## Finding Schema`, `## Change-Type Classifier`, `## Disagreement-Valid Framing` — defines the M48 reviewer-finding contract. Reviewers cite this file by reference and emit findings that conform to the schema below.

## Finding Schema

Every reviewer finding (Claude reviewer, scope-reviewer, Codex reviewer) is a structured object with exactly five fields. Reviewers MUST emit findings in this shape — the review-loop pause gate dispatches on these fields and a finding that omits a field is malformed.

- **`finding_id`** — string. Stable identifier for the finding within the current review round (e.g. `R3-F02` for round 3 finding 02). Used to thread responses across rounds and across the pause-gate UI.
- **`severity`** — one of `low`, `medium`, `high`. Reviewer-assigned magnitude. The pause gate does NOT dispatch on severity — it dispatches on `change_type`. Severity is shown to the user for prioritization within a round.
- **`change_type`** — one of `style`, `clarity`, `correctness`, `scope`, `intent`. The classifier value (see `## Change-Type Classifier` below). Default action of the review loop depends on this field: `style`, `clarity`, `correctness` auto-apply; `scope` and `intent` pause for the user.
- **`message`** — string. Reviewer's prose explanation of the finding. What is wrong, why it matters, and what change would resolve it. Should be self-contained — readable without re-reading the artifact under review.
- **`referenced_files`** — string array. Absolute or repo-relative paths to files cited by the finding. Used by the secondary-escalation rule (see classifier below): a finding whose `referenced_files` cites `feedback/*.md` is escalated to `intent` regardless of the reviewer's primary `change_type` tag.

## Change-Type Classifier

Five categories. Each entry below names the category, gives the rule of thumb, and shows a positive example (a finding that fits the category) and a negative example (a finding that looks similar at a glance but belongs to a different category — to prevent miscategorization).

**Default-action rule.**

- `style`, `clarity`, `correctness` — **auto-apply**. The review loop applies the fix without pausing.
- `scope`, `intent` — **pause**. The review loop stops and surfaces the finding to the user via the batch pause UI with the 3-option menu (apply / skip / loop back to upstream artifact). (Per design.md §"M48 — Review-loop pause on scope/intent findings": batch-with-overrides UI, paused findings listed individually with the inherited 3-option pause menu.)

**Secondary-escalation rule.**

A finding whose `message` mentions, or whose `referenced_files` cites, content under `feedback/*.md` is **escalated to `change_type: intent`** regardless of the reviewer's primary tag. Rationale: `feedback/*.md` captures decisions the user has already made; a finding that contradicts those decisions is intent-level by construction. The pause gate must surface it for explicit user resolution, not auto-apply.

> **Future-hook placeholder (out of scope this run).** When the M44 capture-corpus ships, the secondary-escalation rule will additionally fire on findings citing the capture corpus. Until M44 lands, `feedback/*.md` is the sole escalation source. Do NOT attempt to read a capture corpus from this rule today — it does not yet exist.

### style

Surface-level wording, formatting, punctuation, ordering of items in a list when the order is not load-bearing, or other presentation choices. The fix does not change what the artifact says, only how it says it.

- **Positive example.** Reviewer flags that bullet items in `## Goals` use mixed period/no-period sentence terminators and proposes consistent terminators. The artifact's content is unchanged; only the punctuation is normalized. → `change_type: style`.
- **Negative example (do NOT classify as style).** Reviewer flags that a goal entry's "Why we care" paragraph is hard to follow because three claims are crammed into one sentence. This reads like wording but the proposed fix changes how the reader understands the artifact's substance — that belongs to `clarity`, not `style`.

### clarity

The artifact's content is correct but readers are likely to misread, miss, or struggle to extract a key claim. The fix restructures, splits, or re-orders to surface the claim — the underlying content is unchanged.

- **Positive example.** Reviewer flags that the design.md trade-off section buries the chosen approach in the third paragraph and proposes leading with the decision sentence (claim-before-evidence). → `change_type: clarity`.
- **Negative example (do NOT classify as clarity).** Reviewer flags that a stated design constraint contradicts a constraint declared in goals.md. Reframing wording would not resolve the contradiction — the artifact is internally inconsistent and a reader could be misled into the wrong implementation. That is `correctness`, not `clarity`.

### correctness

A factual error, broken cross-reference, malformed schema, contradictory claim, or other defect that would mislead a downstream agent or human reader. The fix changes what the artifact says.

- **Positive example.** Reviewer flags that structure.md asserts `skills/foo/SKILL.md` exports a function `bar()` but the corresponding plan task spec defines the function as `baz()`. The fix updates one or the other to match. → `change_type: correctness`.
- **Negative example (do NOT classify as correctness).** Reviewer flags that the design.md test-strategy section omits a class of test the reviewer believes belongs there (e.g. fuzz tests for an input parser). Adding tests is a SCOPE change, not a correction — the existing strategy is internally consistent; the reviewer is proposing a new commitment. That is `scope`, not `correctness`.

### scope

The finding proposes adding, removing, or significantly resizing a deliverable, requirement, or commitment. The fix would change what is being built, not just how it is described.

- **Positive example.** Reviewer flags that plan.md's task list does not include a migration script for an existing data store and proposes adding a new task. The artifact is internally consistent; the proposal expands what gets shipped. → `change_type: scope`. Pause the loop.
- **Negative example (do NOT classify as scope).** Reviewer flags that a plan.md task's LOC estimate is wildly off (claimed 50 LOC, plausibly 500 LOC). The deliverables are unchanged; only the estimate is wrong. That is `correctness`, not `scope`.

### intent

The finding contradicts a captured user decision, prior directive, or stated value — something the user has explicitly chosen. Distinct from `scope` because the artifact may already be the right size; the question is whether the *direction* matches what the user asked for.

- **Positive example.** Reviewer flags that goals.md frames goal G3 as solution-prescribing (lists components to build) and proposes rewriting it as problem-framed (Problem / Why we care / What we know so far). User has previously stated "I want goals to be problem-framed, not solution-prescribing" in `feedback/2025-12-01-goals-shape.md`. The finding cites that file in `referenced_files` → secondary-escalation fires → `change_type: intent`. Pause the loop.
- **Negative example (do NOT classify as intent).** Reviewer flags that a goal entry's "What we know so far" mentions five candidate solutions where Design only needs two to evaluate. The user has not made a decision about candidate count anywhere; the reviewer is proposing a trim for readability. That is `clarity` (or possibly `scope` if the trim drops a substantive option), not `intent`.

## Disagreement-Valid Framing

Reviewers operate under an explicit guarantee: **flagging findings that contradict prior user decisions is correct behavior, not a violation.**

If, while reviewing, you (the reviewer) identify a defect, omission, or risk that conflicts with something the user has already approved, captured in `feedback/*.md`, or otherwise committed to — **emit the finding anyway**. Tag it `change_type: intent` per the secondary-escalation rule. The pause gate exists precisely to surface this kind of disagreement for explicit user resolution.

Do NOT self-censor. Do NOT downgrade an `intent` finding to `clarity` to avoid pausing the loop. Do NOT skip the finding because it "feels controversial." A reviewer that withholds findings to keep the loop moving is failing its job — the user has set up the pause gate to handle exactly this situation, and reviewing the artifact against captured intent is part of the contract.

The user's response to a paused finding may be: apply the change, skip it, or loop back to the upstream artifact to revisit the prior decision. Any of those outcomes is fine — the reviewer's job is to surface the disagreement so the user can choose, not to choose on the user's behalf.
